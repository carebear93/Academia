The things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just wo n't fly with most intelligent viewers .

"Cuba Gooding Jr. valiantly mugs his way through Snow Dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy ."	
Diane Lane 's sophisticated performance ca n't rescue Adrian Lyne 's Unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing .	
Not at all clear what it 's trying to say and even if it were -- I doubt it would be all that interesting .	
This remake of Lina Wertmuller 's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since John and Bo Derek made the ridiculous Bolero .

"It 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar American style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through ."	
This dreadfully earnest inversion of the Concubine love triangle eschews the previous film 's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .

"However sincere it may be , The Rising Place never quite justifies its own existence ."	
"Parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place ."

Suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry British filmmakers have strip-mined the Monty formula mercilessly since 1997 .	
"Yes , I have given this movie a rating of zero ."	
But fans of the show should not consider this a diss .

The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough .	
Do we really need the Tiger Beat version ?	
"This Bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better ."

This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic .	
The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .	
"A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages ."	
A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .

... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank .	
"Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?"

A drama ?	
A romance ?	
A cartoon ?	
Did the film inform and educate me ?	
Did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 Armenia ?	
No. .	
And that is where Ararat went astray .	
It 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .	
Has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness .	
It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .	
"Who , exactly , is fighting whom here ?"	
"Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze ."	
"A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces ."	
"Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster ."	
"Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter ."

"Maybe it 's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , I want a little more than this ."	
"A graceless , witless attempt at mating Some Like It Hot with the WWII espionage thriller ."

"Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola 's inadequate performance ."

A mostly tired retread of several other mob tales .	
"I wish I could say `` Thank God It 's Friday '' , but the truth of the matter is I was glad when it was over ."	
Nothing about it fits .	
"As it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them ."	
"Somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become G.I. Jane ."	
The cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .	
Consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .	
The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .	
I tried to read the time on my watch .	
"The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. ."

"The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing ."	
"The movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel ."	
"Once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care ."	
There 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .	
"It seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less ."	
"The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover ."	
"Even by dumb action-movie standards , Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever is a dumb action movie ."	
The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .

"You would be better off investing in the worthy EMI recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 Malfitano-Domingo production ."

"Drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that Three Seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality ."	
The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .	
Fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .	
And forget about any attempt at a plot !

Passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless .	
"Safe Conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull 's - eye ."	
My response to the film is best described as lukewarm .	
Maybe I found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .

A sudsy cautionary tale .

"The only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team ."	
"One of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating ."	
... this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core .	
Murder By Numbers is like a couple of mediocre TV-movie - of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .	
Warmed-over Tarantino by way of wannabe Elmore Leonard .

There 's not enough to sustain the comedy .	
"Like those to Rome , all roads in The Banger Sisters inevitably lead to a joke about Hawn 's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them ."	
We may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the Balkans conflict .	
You 're better off staying home and watching The X-Files .	
"Chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it 's ... like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror ."

If High Crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .	
"Reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film ."	
The movie makes absolutely no sense .	
Its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : Since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?	
The problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .

"The pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie 's final scenes ."	
The premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the Clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .	
"With its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , The Ring makes its stupidity more than obvious ."	
It 's painful .	
An uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .	
Sheridan ... smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .	
An atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .

Enough similarities to Gymkata and Howie Long 's Firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs .	
"If this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called The Hills Have Antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins ."	
"A frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that does n't exactly favour the audience ."	
"Like a documentary version of Fight Club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest ."	
`` An entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . ''	
"Pryor Lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs ."	
"What 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class ."	
The stories here suffer from the chosen format .	
"While the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun ."	
Just how extreme are these ops ?	
I regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .	
The actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .

The Master Of Disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .	
"The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter ."	
"It 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana 's future ."	
A film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not .	
"None of this violates the letter of Behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor ."	
"Bad Company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script ."	
"Even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat ."	
Fails to bring as much to the table .	
"A film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy Hollywood caper flick ."	
Disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .

"... pitiful , slapdash disaster ."	
A DOA dud from frame one .	
"Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company ."	
"Although God Is Great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it 's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film ."	
The dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film .	
First-timer John McKay is never able to pull it back on course .	
"Distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register ."

"The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off ."	
"Evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention ."	
A derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches .	
"Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin ."	
"As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four ."	
"Limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly ."	
Just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name .	
"The redeeming feature of Chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine ."

Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear .	
But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .

This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering .	
"Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep ."	
Who is this movie for ?

It never rises to its clever what-if concept .	
Admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .	
This story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour .

The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .	
"The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama ."	
"There 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do Joan and Philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery ."

I 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment .	
There 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease .

"This is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like Them !"	
"At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue ."	
A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be .	
A crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a Kiss .	
"The film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments ."

"Both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded ."	
Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .	
Neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .	
Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting .	
Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .

Why would anyone cast the magnificent Jackie Chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?	
"A grating , emaciated flick ."	
"Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook ."	
Presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency .	
"We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat ."	
But you 'd never guess that from the performances .	
"The animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies ."	
Ararat feels like a book report	
"Steve Oedekerk is , alas , no Woody Allen ."	
"A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless ."	
"An amalgam of The Fugitive , Blade Runner , and Total Recall , only without much energy or tension ."

"If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it ."	
A feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about .

The problems of the people in Love in the Time of Money are hardly specific to their era .

"Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . '"	
So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .

The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of Bewitched that takes place during Spring Break .	
"Well made but uninvolving , Bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery ."	
"So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the 13th by way of Clean and Sober , filmed on the set of Carpenter 's The Thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat ."	
The movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster .	
"Kids do n't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there 's lots of cute animals and clumsy people ."	
` Snow Dogs ' has both .	
It 's almost as if it 's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .

What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !	
The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film .	
Opera on film is never satisfactory .	
The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .	
"Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless ."	
"It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill"	
The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste .	
It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .	
"Terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable ."	
"Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships ."

A big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .	
The story has little wit and no surprises .

"as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary ."	
Plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp .	
The central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest .	
A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .	
"Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be ."	
"A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium ."	
"There 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film ."	
The biggest problem with Satin Rouge is Lilia herself .	
"She 's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but does n't reveal an inner life ."	
"What with the incessant lounge music playing in the film 's background , you may mistake Love Liza for an Adam Sandler Chanukah song ."	
A potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted .

Been there done that .	
There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew .	
A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work .	
"Schnitzler 's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying ."	
"Even if it made its original release date last fall , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness ."

"It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down ."	
"The actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen ."	
"A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find ."	
"If there 's a heaven for bad movies , Deuces Wild is on its way ."	
Comes off like a bad imitation of the Bard .	
What 's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behaviour .	
Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .	
Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .	
Slackers ' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film 's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .	
"If Festival in Cannes nails hard - boiled Hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing ."	
The movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .	
I have n't seen such self-amused trash since Freddy Got Fingered .	
Little more than a well-mounted history lesson .	
"Rob Schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian ."

"It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast ."	
"Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance ."	
"Its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack , might have made a point or two regarding life ."	
It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .	
"Neither as scary-funny as Tremors nor demented-funny as Starship Troopers , the movie is n't tough to take as long as you 've paid a matinee price ."	
"If swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh ."	
"The Master of Disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live sketch , but a great movie it is not ."	
It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .	
"Boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect ."	
It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .	
"Unfortunately , that 's precisely what Arthur Dong 's Family Fundamentals does ."	
Has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it 's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick .	
"Like a medium-grade network sitcom -- mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen ."	
Something must have been lost in the translation .	
Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any Plympton film : boring .	
"In the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses ."	
Chan 's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .	
Rock 's stand-up magic wanes .

There ai n't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it 's hilarious .	
What a pity ... that the material is so second-rate .

Strictly a ` guy 's film ' in the worst sense of the expression .	
"There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes ."	
"It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix 's ."	
There 's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids ' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where Santa gives gifts to grownups .	
"We 're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments ."	
"Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories ."	
There is nothing redeeming about this movie .	
"I was trying to decide what annoyed me most about God is Great ... I 'm Not , and then I realized that I just did n't care ."	
Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .	
... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .	
Brosnan 's finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .	
"To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy ."	
Tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often .	
"Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up ."	
ZigZag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .	
How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ?	
Nicks and Steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try .	
Episode II -- Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .	
The problem with all of this : It 's not really funny .	
"Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from Lynch , Jeunet , and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own ."

"Writer-director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags ."

"Choppy , overlong documentary about ` The Lifestyle . '"	
One sloughs one 's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .	
"A film which presses familiar Herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised ."	
The story itself is actually quite vapid .	
"It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s ."	
Wait for pay per view or rental but do n't dismiss BarberShop out of hand .

The project 's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting .

A really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .	
"Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand ."	
"It is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment ."	
"For its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen ."	
A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .	
Upper Teens may get cynical .

It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .	
"Most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river ."

It 's fitfully funny but never really takes off .	
"I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but Lil Bow Wow takes the cake ."	
"For all the complications , it 's all surprisingly predictable ."

But it was n't .	
"For a film about action , Ultimate X is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype ."	
"... a low rate Annie featuring some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of Jordan , and weirdo actor Crispin Glover screwing things up old school ."	
"It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness ."	
"The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain ."	
Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic .	
It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .

"It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind ."	
An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .	
A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .	
Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .

Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .	
How about surprising us by trying something new ?	
Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .	
"Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material ."

More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .	
"An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle ."

It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .	
A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .	
There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .
